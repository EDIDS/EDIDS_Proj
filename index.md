### Introduction
“Extraction” is a text adventure that comes to life from the renowned Ubisoft video game, “**Rainbow Six Extraction**”. In a world upset by an alien parasitic invasion, chaos and destruction reign supreme. You, a valiant warrior of the elite Rainbow team, have been selected for a mission of vital importance. Your task is to infiltrate a building, confront and defeat the archons that hinder your path, and save your imprisoned companion. Your mission is dangerous, but the hope of a better world rests on your shoulders.

## Graphic interface and movement control 
The graphic interface was created using a framework known as “Swing”, (which requires further details to fully understand its operation).

The interface displays the building’s map, highlighting the different rooms that the player can visit. At the bottom of the interface, there are four buttons: North, South, East, and West, which guide the player’s movement. If the chosen direction does not lead to a room, the movement is prevented. Each room can host an alien and a variety of objects that the player can eventually collect. All this information is displayed on the screen.

## The Game
The game is set in a building overrun by an alien parasite. A member of the Rainbow team has been taken hostage by these aliens, and your primary goal will be to locate and rescue him, exiting the building. During your mission, you may encounter some of these aliens, whom you will have to fight or from whom you will have to escape. If you lose all your life during a fight, the game will end.

Throughout the game, you will have the opportunity to:

- Explore various rooms where you can find useful items to collect.
- Be mindful of the number of items you can carry and the total weight you can bear. If necessary, you can remove unnecessary items from your inventory.
- Save the game at any point. From the initial menu, you will also have the option to load a previously saved game.
