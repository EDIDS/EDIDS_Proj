    5) If choice is defend, decrease enemy's attack by player's defense and decrease player's health by that value
        (e.g. alien's attack = 20, defense = 10 -> health 100 => 90)
    6) If choice is elude, get the percentage of eluding that enemy and a random number between 0 and 1 and decrease
        player's health by enemy's attack only if the number is greater than the percentage
        (e.g. percentage = 0.7, random number = 0.6 -> nothing happens)
    7) If choice is cure, search the bag for a medikit and if the research ends successfully set player's health to its
        maximum value, otherwise display error message (e.g. "No medikit found")
    8) If choice is run, get the percentage of running away from that enemy and a random number between 0 and 1 and end
        the fight only if the number is smaller than the percentage (e.g. percentage = 0.7, random number = 0.6 -> fight ends)
    9) End game if player's health reaches 0 (Game Over)
